        'The cost of investing has been steadily falling, and Peter Crawford, Schwab’s chief financial officer, acknowledged in a statement that the elimination of trading commissions had been pretty much inevitable.\n' +
        '“We are seeing new firms trying to enter our market — using zero- or low-equity commissions as a lever,” Mr. Crawford said. “We’re not feeling competitive pressure from these firms … yet. But we don’t want to fall into the trap that a myriad of other firms in a variety of industries have fallen into and wait too long to respond to new entrants.”\n' +
        'The commission-free trading structure will go into effect Monday for accounts of all sizes, wiping out Schwab’s $4.95-per-trade charge. (Option investors will continue to pay 65 cents per contract, though commissions were eliminated.)\n' +
        'It’s a noteworthy move coming from Schwab, which, once upon a time, was the new entrant paving the way for retail investors. And it’s a mark of how drastically the investment industry has changed over the past decade: Access to the stock and bond markets has never been easier or cheaper.\n' +
        'In recent years, small investors have become able to trade a wide collection of exchange-traded funds without charge — and they could build entire portfolios on their own with little effort and for little money. They also have more options to outsource the job entirely to mostly automated services, which will build and monitor your nest egg for a tiny fraction of the cost of your grandfather’s financial adviser.\n' +

        'Firms that forgo fees can make money in other ways, Mr. Bryan said. For example, the cash in your brokerage account — money you haven’t yet invested — may be pushed into the firm’s money market account during hours when the market is closed. While you do earn interest as a result, it’s below the market rate, and the firm pockets the difference.\n' +
        '“Keep in mind that these firms aren’t charities,” Mr. Bryan said.\n' +
        'The new plan will cost Schwab roughly 3 to 4 percent of its total net revenue — perhaps $100 million each quarter. But the firm noted that its “commissions per revenue trade” have been falling for several years, which may have given Schwab the confidence to become the first major firm to eliminate commissions across the board.\n' +

They were meant to give the economy a little bit of extra padding in case risks on the horizon — from uncertainty created by President Trump’s trade war to economic weakening in Asia and Europe that threatened to spill over — turned into realities.\n' +

They could signal that more aggressive rate cuts are coming, rather than the gentle midbusiness cycle adjustments underway.\n' +

Unemployment is near a half-century low. Consumers continue to spend, and housing starts have headed higher.\n' +

        "The small firm effect is a theory that holds that smaller firms, or those companies with a small market capitalization, outperform larger companies. Publicly traded companies are classified into three categories: large-cap ($10 billion +), mid-cap ($2-$10 billion), and small-cap (< $2 billion). Most small capitalization firms are startups or relatively young companies with high-growth potential. Within this class of stocks, there are even smaller classifications: micro-cap ($50 million - $2 billion) and nano-cap (<$50 million).\n" +
        "The small firm effect market anomaly is a factor used to explain superior returns in Gene Fama and Kenneth French's Three-Factor Model, with the three factors being the market return, companies with high book-to-market values, and small stock capitalization. Of course, verification of this phenomenon is subject to some time period bias. The time period examined when looking for instances in which small-cap stocks outperform large-caps largely influences whether the researcher will find any instance of the small firm effect. At times, the small firm effect is used as a rationale for the higher fees that are often charged by fund companies for small-cap funds.\n" +
        "Understanding the Small Firm Effect\n" +
        "The small firm effect theory holds that smaller companies have a greater amount of growth opportunities than larger companies. Small-cap companies also tend to have a more volatile business environment, and the correction of problems—such as the correction of a funding deficiency—can lead to a large price appreciation.\n" +
        "Finally, small-cap stocks tend to have lower stock prices, and these lower prices mean that price appreciations tend to be larger than those found among large-cap stocks. Tagging onto the small firm effect is the January effect, which refers to the stock price pattern exhibited by small-cap stocks in late December and early January. Generally, these stocks rise during that period, making small-cap funds even more attractive to investors.\n" +
        " The small firm effect is not foolproof as large-cap stocks generally outperform small-cap stocks during recessions.\n" +
        "Small Firm Effect Versus Neglected Firm Effect\n" +
        "The small firm effect is often confused with the neglected firm effect. The neglected firm effect theorizes that publicly traded companies that are not followed closely by analysts tend to outperform those that receive attention or are scrutinized. The small firm effect and the neglected firm effect are not mutually exclusive. Some small-cap companies may be ignored by analysts, and so both theories can apply.\n" +
        "Advantages of the Small Firm Effect\n" +
        "Small-cap stocks tend to be more volatile than large-cap funds, but they potentially offer the greatest return. Small-cap companies have more room to grow than their larger counterparts. For example, it's easier for cloud computing company Appian (APPN) to double, or even triple, in size than Microsoft.\n" +
        "Disadvantages of the Small Firm Effect\n" +
        "On the other hand, it's much easier for a small-cap company to become insolvent than a large-cap company. Using the previous example, Microsoft has plenty of capital, a strong business model, and an even stronger brand, making it less susceptible to failure than small firms with none of those attributes.", users[1]._id, 3);

        'Surprise, surprise: The Federal Reserve decreased interest rates by a smidge (a quarter percentage point), making it cheaper for Americans to borrow money. The decision was widely expected, and was meant to juice the slowing economy. But Fed officials are still sharply divided on how much the rate cut was needed, considering that the economy is still pretty robust — unemployment is low, people are spending and wages are on the rise. On the flip side, more hawkish economists (and Mr. Trump) want the Fed to cut rates more drastically to head off a potential recession. But no one can agree how much of a threat that really is. Saudi Arabia could take months to fully restore oil output after its biggest oil-processing plant was attacked last Saturday by … well, it’s still not entirely clear. The Trump administration blames Iran, whose government denies it. Meanwhile, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are backed by Iran, are claiming responsibility, but no one believes that they had the resources to pull it off. Either way, the attack has squeezed the world’s oil supply, and Saudi Arabia has tapped into reserves to keep it flowing. Here in the United States, Mr. Trump is threatening retaliation against Iran, although it’s unclear what that means. His top priority? Keeping oil prices down and the economy steady, which would be hard to do if tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia escalate further.\n' +

        'Now for the latest chapter in the Brexit saga: Britain’s Supreme Court is expected to make a decision this week about the legality of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament two weeks ago. If he gets the thumbs up, he’ll be allowed to push forward with his Brexit plan (or lack thereof) unencumbered by his political opponents. But if the court doesn’t rule in his favor, his leadership will be seriously compromised — along with Brexit itself.

        'The Fed keeps a close eye on how fast the economy is expanding because the pace of growth is crucial to its two main goals: reaching maximum employment and maintaining stable inflation around 2 percent. A slowdown could prevent policymakers from hitting their long-elusive inflation goal, and a downturn might lead to higher unemployment.\n' +
        'For now, consumers are powering the economy ahead. Unemployment is low, wages are rising and households are spending. But surveys in recent months have shown consumer sentiment may be wavering, a cause for concern if it bleeds into real-life behavior. Consumers fuel about 70 percent of the economy. The United States is in a comparatively strong position compared with other large economic powers: China’s economy has already begun to slow, Japan is nowhere near hitting its inflation target despite negative interest rates and Europe is showing cracks as Germany teeters on the brink of a recession.\n' +
        'Against that backdrop, countries around the world have been cutting borrowing costs. Last week, the European Central Bank cut one of its policy rates to a record low and rolled out a broader package of monetary stimulus.\n' +
